             <p>I am a first year btech student in IIT Madras. Let me share my experience enjoying one year life in IIT Madras.

It was the first time I saw IIT Madras or rather I can say first time to see any IIT, It was for my document verification and seat acceptance day. I came all way from Calicut ( my place ) eagerly waiting to see an IIT. Then I reached IITM gate and then I went inside to see “IITM” but there nothing,,., it was like entering a garden there was no buildings or nothing but trees all over .The security guided us to get into the bus to SAC ( Student Activity Centre) .It was rush inside the bus and I was standing and through the window I was looking to see something to make myself amaze, but all I saw on my way to SAC was building of all departments.</p>
